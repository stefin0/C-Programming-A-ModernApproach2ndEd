/*
7. The power function of Section 9.6 can be made faster by having it calculate
x^n in a different way. We first notice that if n is a power of 2, then x^n can
be computed by squaring. For example, x^4 is the square of x^2, so x^4 can be
computed using only two multiplications instead of three. As it happens, this
technique can be used even when n is not a power of 2. If n is even, we use the
formula x^n = (x^n/2)^2. If n is odd, then x^n = x * x^(n-1). Write a recursive
function that computes x^n. (The recursion ends when n = 0, in which case the
function returns 1.) To test your function, write a program that asks the user
to enter values for x and n, calls power to compute x^n, and then displays the
value returned by the function

int power(int x, int n);

int main(void) {
  int x, n;

  printf("This program evaluates x^n\n");
  printf("x = ");
  scanf("%d", &x);
  printf("n = ");
  scanf("%d", &n);

  printf("%d^%d = %d\n", x, n, power(x, n));

  return 0;
}

int power(int x, int n) {
  if (n <= 0) {
    return 1;
  }

  // Check if n is even
  if (n % 2 == 0) {
    int half_power = power(x, n / 2);
    return half_power * half_power;
  } else {
    return x * power(x, n - 1);
  }
