/*
Write a program that tests whether two words are anagrams (permutations of the
same letters):
Enter first word: smartest
Enter second word: mattress
The words are anagrams.
Enter first word: dumbest
Enter second word: stumble
The words are not anagrams.
Write a loop that reads the first word, character by character, using an array
of 26 integers to keep track of how many times each letter has been seen. (For
example, after the word smartest has been read, the array should contain the
values 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0. reflecting the fact
that smartest contains one a. one e. one m. one r, two sâ€™s and two fs.) Use
another loop to read the second word, except this time decrementing the
corresponding array element as each letter is read. Both loops should ignore any
characters that aren't letters, and both should treat upper-case letters in the
same way as lower-case letters. After the second word has been read, use a third
loop to check whether all the elements in the array are zero. If so. the words
are anagrams. Hint: You may wish to use functions from <ctype.h>, such as
isalpha and tolower.
